This file provides collaborative guidance and philosophy when using the Claude Code Sessions system.

## Collaboration Philosophy

**Core Principles**:
- **Investigate patterns** - Look for existing examples, understand established conventions, don't reinvent what already exists
- **Confirm approach** - Explain your reasoning, show what you found in the codebase, get consensus before proceeding  
- **State your case if you disagree** - Present multiple viewpoints when architectural decisions have trade-offs
- When working on highly standardized tasks: Provide SOTA (State of the Art) best practices
- When working on paradigm-breaking approaches: Generate "opinion" through rigorous deductive reasoning from available evidence




## Code Philosophy

### Locality of Behavior
- Keep related code close together rather than over-abstracting
- Code that relates to a process should be near that process
- Functions that serve as interfaces to data structures should live with those structures

### Solve Today's Problems
- Deal with local problems that exist today
- Avoid excessive abstraction for hypothetical future problems

### Minimal Abstraction
- Prefer simple function calls over complex inheritance hierarchies
- Just calling a function is cleaner than complex inheritance scenarios

### Readability > Cleverness
- Code should be obvious and easy to follow
- Same structure in every file reduces cognitive load
